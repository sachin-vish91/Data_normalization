# Data Normalization
In case where we have multiple data set and we want to normalize them without merging them into one single file, specially when the data sets are very large. There are two function first one to normalized the data that will return the value between 0 and 1. Second function will de-normalize the data into the original values.

**x** = input (numpy array) <br />
**overall_min** = the min value of all the data set <br />
**overall_max** = the max value of all the data set
